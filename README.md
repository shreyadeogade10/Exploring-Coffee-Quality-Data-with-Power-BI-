# Exploring-Coffee-Quality-Data-with-Power-BI

This repository contains a data analytics project focused on exploring and visualizing coffee quality data using Power BI. The project aims to uncover insights about coffee beans from various regions by analyzing quality metrics such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and defects. By leveraging Power BI's powerful data visualization capabilities, the project provides an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders understand and interpret coffee quality data.

**Key Features**:

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Prepare raw coffee quality data for analysis by handling missing values, categorizing defects, and transforming data for Power BI compatibility.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Power BI to perform in-depth analysis of key coffee quality attributes, including sensory evaluations, defects, and regional variations.

Interactive Dashboard: Create an intuitive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore coffee quality metrics through dynamic charts, filters, and visuals.

Regional Analysis: Analyze how coffee quality varies across different regions, highlighting the influence of geographic factors on coffee characteristics.

Defects and Impact: Visualize the impact of Category One and Category Two defects on overall coffee quality and cup scores.

Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations for coffee producers and suppliers based on the analysis.

**Technologies Used**:

Power BI (Data visualization and dashboard creation)

Python/Excel (Optional: Data preprocessing)

Coffee Quality Dataset (Sample data for analysis)

**Project Structure**:

PowerBI_Dashboard/: Power BI files, including the interactive dashboard and supporting reports.

Data/: Cleaned coffee quality datasets used in the analysis.

Scripts/: Any Python or Excel scripts used for data preprocessing.

README.md: Detailed documentation on the project, including setup instructions and a guide to using the Power BI dashboard.
